\noindent This thesis documents my research into formalized
score control, in order to demonstrate a computational model of music
composition. When working computationally, models provide an explicit formal
description of what objects exist within a given domain, how they behave, and
what transformations they afford. The clearer the model becomes, the easier it
is to extend and to construct increasingly higher-order abstractions around
that model. In other words, a clear computational model of music notation
affords the development of a clear model of music composition. The Abjad API
for Formalized Score Control, an open-source software library written in the
Python programming language and making use of the LilyPond automated
typesetting system for graphical output, is presented as such a computational
model of music notation. My own compositional modeling work, extending Abjad,
is introduced and analyzed in the Python library Consort. A collection of five
scores, each implemented as Python packages extending these software libraries,
are included. Three of these scores, \enquote{Zaira}, \enquote{Armilla} and
\enquote{Ersilia}, rely on Consort as their compositional engine, and are
presented along with their complete sources. These scores demonstrate my
development as a composer investigating the role of computation in music, and
display a variety of large-scale structures and musical textures made possible
when working with such modeling tools.
